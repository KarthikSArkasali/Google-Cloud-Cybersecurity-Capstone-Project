# Respond and Recover from a data breach

# Activity overview
This lab is part of the capstone project. In this lab, you’ll apply your knowledge of cloud cybersecurity to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

You’ll be given a scenario, and a set of tasks to complete in Google Cloud Security Command Center. These tasks will require you to use your skills to work to analyze and remediate active vulnerabilities relating to a security incident, answer questions about the vulnerabilities, and complete challenges that will assess your cloud cybersecurity skills.

There are also a number of challenges in the lab. A challenge is a task where you will be asked to complete the task on your own without instructions.

By successfully completing this lab, you will demonstrate your ability to identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within the cloud environment. These are essential skills to enhance the security posture of Google Cloud environments, reducing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security incidents.
